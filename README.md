# Stripe API

This project was aimed to implement Payment/Checkout from Stripe API with a simple UI and testing parameters. Using the built in functions to Stripe, this web application sends a POST request to the Stripe API with the user's cart, creates a session, then sends a GET request to send that session back to the client. The client uses a unique ID generated by the session to redirect to the checkout page when the user clicks a button.
